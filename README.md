# wistiaComponent
Wistia component for process street

# Start
*To start the file, clone the repository and use `npm install` to load all required modules
*Use `npm start` to start the local server, then browse to `localhost:3000` to view the widget.

##How it works
I created a component called `<wistia>` with an attribute `pass`. The `pass` attribute
contains the password for the wistia account you wish to post the video to.
I used blue imps jquery file uploader for the file upload process.
